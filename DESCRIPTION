Description: Extends the capabilities of 'ggplot2' by providing grammatical
    elements and plot helpers designed for visualizing temporal patterns. The 
    package implements a grammar of temporal graphics, which leverages calendar
    structures to highlight changes over time. The package also provides plot 
    helper functions to quickly produce commonly used time series graphics,
    including time plots, season plots, and seasonal sub-series plots.
